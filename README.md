# AoPS-Auto
This repo contains scripts that can help you automate the tedious task of saving every lesson transcript and homework page when your AoPS class ends.

Instructions:
This requires you to have the Keyboard library installed. It can be found here:

1. Open up your desired script (depending on whether you are going to save lesson transcripts or homework)
2. Look at line 4. You may need to change the number after "week < ..." depending on your class length. You should change it to your class length in weeks + 1.
2. Go to your first week's transcript or homework page. You need to save the first page manually so your computer knows where to save future pages.
3. Start the script. Make sure your browser window is focused.
